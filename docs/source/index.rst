Flamedisx is a a modeling and inference framework for liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs). It builds models with deterministic, differentiable TensorFlow computations rather than Monte Carlo simnulations. This increases the practical number of dimensions and parameters for likelihoods in LXe TPC direct detection.
