Flamedisx is a a modeling and inference framework for liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs). It builds models with deterministic, differentiable TensorFlow computations rather than Monte Carlo simulations. This increases the practical number of dimensions and parameters for likelihood functions used in LXe TPC experiments.
