XENON-specific flamedisx code
==============================

This folder contains:
  * Tools for interfacing with public and private XENON information (pax, strax, bbf, etc.)
  * Flamedisx models for XENON1T. These are not used for any XENON1T publication. We used the SR0 models for the flamedisx paper. 
   
Do NOT put here:
  * Private XENON data
  * XENONnT models
